This is a simple guessing game to play with Alexa. You guess a number, she tells you if it's higher or lower. At the beginning of each game, Alexa will tell you how many times you've played.

If you’re in the US, we've also included the new [speechcons](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speechcon-reference) feature for Alexa skill development. Speechcons are special words and phrases that Alexa pronounces more expressively. We use them in this quiz game to let the user know whether they gave a correct or incorrect answer during the quiz.
